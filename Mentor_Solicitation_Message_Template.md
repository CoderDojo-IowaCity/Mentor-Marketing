Mentoring Opportunity at CoderDojo [City]!

Hello [FirstName], 

CoderDojo [City] is seeking developers of all skill levels who are interested in sharing their knowledge with local youth. The time commitment required is very low since the monthly sessions only last a couple hours and no preparation is necessary on your part because we will be using resources like codecademy.com. CoderDojo is a worldwide non-profit group founded to teach young people (ages 7-17) to code. This is a great opportunity to get to know other developers in the area while making a positive impact in our community. 

Your LinkedIn profile came up in a search for PHP developers within a 10 mile radius of [City]. If you are no longer in the [City] area, we apologize! 

Our kickoff session will be on [Date and Time] at [location] with future meetings to be held on the first and third Saturday of the month. The number of students allowed to participate each month will be based on mentor participation, so we really need your help to make CoderDojo [City] a success! 

If you are interested in mentoring at CoderDojo [City] please complete the mentor signup form at
[Mentor Signup Form Link].  Please note that mentors and volunteers must pass a professional background check as required by the CoderDojo organization.

If you are unable to assist at this time but you have colleagues, friends, or family members who might be interested in volunteering or participating in CoderDojo [City], please ask them to visit our website at 
[Website Link] . 

We appreciate your time and we hope you will take advantage of this exciting and unique opportunity to be a role model to kids and teens in our area! 

Thank you, 
[Your name]
